# Core Concepts and Advanced Configurations

1. JPA Fundamentals and Spring Data JPA Architecture
   - JPA vs Hibernate vs Spring Data JPA - architectural differences and benefits
   - Entity lifecycle (Transient, Managed, Detached, Removed)
   - EntityManager and PersistenceContext
   - Transaction management (@Transactional, propagation levels, isolation levels)

2. Entity Mappings and Relationships
   - Entity design best practices
   - Inheritance strategies (@MappedSuperclass, @Inheritance)
   - Complex relationships (@OneToMany, @ManyToMany, @ElementCollection)
   - Lazy vs Eager loading - performance implications
   - Bidirectional relationships and handling circular references

3. Repository Layer Implementation
   - CrudRepository vs JpaRepository vs PagingAndSortingRepository
   - Query methods (derived queries, JPQL, native queries)
   - @Query annotation with named and indexed parameters
   - Projections (interface-based, class-based, dynamic)
   - Specifications and criteria API for dynamic queries

4. Performance Optimization
   - First and second-level caching strategies
   - N+1 problem and solutions
   - Batch processing (@BatchSize, bulk operations)
   - Query optimization and execution plan analysis
   - Connection pooling configuration (HikariCP)

# Advanced Features and Real-world Scenarios

1. Advanced JPA Features
   - Auditing (@EntityListeners, @CreatedBy, @LastModifiedBy)
   - Versioning and optimistic locking
   - Soft deletes implementation
   - Custom ID generators
   - Event listeners and callbacks

2. Testing and Best Practices
   - Unit testing repositories
   - Integration testing with @DataJpaTest
   - Test data management (TestEntityManager)
   - Database migration strategies (Flyway/Liquibase)
   - Transaction boundaries and service layer design

3. Real-world Implementation Patterns
   - Repository patterns for microservices
   - Multi-tenancy implementation
   - Handling large datasets (pagination, streaming results)
   - Caching strategies in distributed systems
   - Event sourcing and CQRS with Spring Data JPA

4. Common Interview Topics and Code Reviews
   - Performance tuning case studies
   - Debugging common JPA issues
   - Migration strategies (legacy to Spring Data JPA)
   - Best practices for schema evolution
   - Code review checklist for JPA implementations

## Practice Areas to Focus On

1. Complex Queries
   - Write and optimize complex JPQL queries
   - Implement dynamic queries using Specifications
   - Handle complex joins and aggregations

2. Performance Scenarios
   - Identify and fix N+1 queries
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Optimize batch operations

3. Design Patterns
   - Repository pattern implementation
   - Service layer transaction management
   - Event-driven architectures with JPA

4. Integration Scenarios
   - Multiple database configuration
   - Integration with other Spring modules
   - Error handling and recovery patterns

Note:
- Focus on real-world scenarios you've encountered in your 9 years of experience
- Prepare examples of performance optimization challenges you've solved
- Review recent Spring Data JPA updates and best practices
- Practice explaining complex concepts in a clear, concise manner
- Keep architectural trade-offs in mind when discussing different approaches
